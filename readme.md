Hola. <br />
This projects contains 2 implementation of classic games using turtle : <br />
1) Pong (Multiplayer) : a table tennisâ€“themed twitch arcade sports video game <br />
2) Snake : game where the player maneuvers a growing line that becomes a primary obstacle to itself <br />

Basic user interface to navigate and select between the games

Pong : Two players could play at the same time using up, down and w, s keys<br />
The ball will increase it speed following every hit with the player slab hence increasing the difficulty at each level
